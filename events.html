        you can grow in faith, find peace, and connect with people who genuinely

        walk alongside you. Take your time to settle in, knowing that you are

          3rd Sunday). Come out and enjoy our Bible Study nights where we serve
          food and drinks after each service of studying the Lords word. Our
          Youth Nights are filled with exciting events for our children of the
          church ages 2-17 are allowed to attend there may be a pajama movie
          night, a simple pizza night, or a field trip planned to keep our youth
